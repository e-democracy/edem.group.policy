Discontinued
============

With the 2014 design, edem.group.policy is being discontinued because the
information in it's policy tab has been incorporated into the Membership Info
widget of `edem.group.member.info`_.

Introduction
============

The *Policy* tab on the *Group* page provides information about the policy that
governs activities on the group. These policies generally include the privacy
level of the group (which is included via gs.group.privacy), allowed rate of
posting, the forum manager of the group, and links to additional policy 
documents.
